This repository houses our predictive model designed to forecast outcomes of English Premier League football matches. The primary objective of this project was to develop a predictive algorithm that surpasses the average accuracy of bookmakers, which stands at 53%. By leveraging extensive data sets, including team performance metrics and match conditions, our model successfully achieved this goal. \\

This repo also includes a report in which we discuss our methodologies, as well as model evaluations and results.
